# collect-collectors-resources

Tekton task to collect collectors related resources.

The purpose of this task is to collect all the resources related with the collectors feature and supply
them to other tasks in the pipeline by creating json files for each resource. This task is similar
to collect-data but it only collects a subset of the resources. Specifically those related to collectors.

A task result is returned for each resource with the relative path to the stored JSON for it in the workspace.
