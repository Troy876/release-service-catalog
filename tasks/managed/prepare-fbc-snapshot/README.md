# prepare-fbc-snapshot

Task to update snapshot with multi-OCP version data by extracting OCP versions from container images
and resolving index templates with component-specific OCP versions and release suffixes.

This task runs in parallel with prepare-fbc-parameters and focuses solely on snapshot data transformation.
It extracts OCP versions from container image annotations, resolves index templates with {{OCP_VERSION}}
placeholders, and updates the original snapshot with component-specific resolved indexes. These resolved
indexes take into account the OCP version targeted as well as the release strategy (i.e. hotfix and preGA).
