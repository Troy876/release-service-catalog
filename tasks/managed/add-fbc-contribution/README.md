# add-fbc-contribution

Task to create internalrequests to add fbc contributions to index images. It can batch
multiple fragments into a single IIB request and can also split requests according
to their OCP versions.

This task batches FBC fragments to submit them to IIB in sets of params.maxBatchSize.
The Snapshot has been previously augmented by prepare-fbc-snapshot to include OCP and
target index metadata for each component.

In this task, we split fragments up by their OCP versions and then process each of these
in series. For each OCP version, we chain together batches so that the final targetIndex
produced will have all fragments added. This means that the index_image from one internal
request will be set as the fromIndex for the next request within that OCP version.

Since we have seen flakiness in IIB requests in the past, we retry and failed batches
and internal requests can attach onto currently in progress IIB requests. We retry batches
at the end to allow for timed out requests to finish so that we can just get the final
result. This will slightly compress the time in which batches are entered into the IIB
queue to reduce the effect of a full queue on a single release.
